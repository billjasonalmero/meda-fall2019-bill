For my Project four gallery website. I have to create three webpages. All linked to each other. For my main page I have 10 images, for my gallery 1 I have 10 images, and for my gallery 2 I have 10 images. Each of my web page galley have one specific topic. For my main web page the topic go my images is focused on apple desktop. The gallery one webpage it focuses on food images. Lastly the gallery two webpage it focuses on the New York city buildings. All images are gathered from a website (www.pexels.com) that allows non-commercial or commercial purpose images.

The design template for my gallery website has a navigator, a body and a footer. The header containers a h1 title which is called "Project Four"along with a ul contains the links of gallery one and gallery two. The body page has a contains the title of the webpage, a container with ten images. Lastly I created a footer located at the bottom of the website. For my back ground color I prefer I grey neutral color. The colors for the navigation and body had a mixture of purple and blue.
