For my website my structure will have a title called Bill Jason. The Navigation header with links listed About, Education, Experience and Hobbies.
The main color theme of my website will have a more simplistic color consisting of a orange, grey and white.The Home page will consist of a large image with a text that describes about me. Underneath is a section where a user can subscribe to any email and newsletter can get notification for any updates about my portfolio. The next section will a section that the heading title is called About. The second section heading title will be Education. The third section heading title will be called experience and the last section heading title will be called hobbies. If you scroll at the very bottom of the I added a footer section that will give a user linked to any more information about me. 

When searching for examples of portfolio's in the internet I saw Colin Grist website I didn't like the video pop up at the main page because it prevents me from clicking his navagation bar. I like how clear his header is which he decided to write his name. In his home page in where the main tag is located he added a large banner image after the image section he added a list of his portfolio sorted in a block design. I like how he did this because it shows a evenly distributed space in the website how show his works of art. In his website in the bottom section his footer tag he added his name, e-mail, contact information and what I like the the right side of his header is a list of his social media that you can link and follow him.
