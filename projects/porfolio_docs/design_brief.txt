 For my website the theme ons focused on Investing. The reason why I chose this theme is because I am very fascinated investing can help people grow their income in time. For my website design I could implement a clean and very simplistic look. My idea for the color theme is Green/Grey/White. The title would be "Investhub". The Home page will consist of information for people with no experience on how to invest and learn about about stocks, banks, and retirement. I will create a four part navigating subject which is About Investhub category, Stocks category, Banks Category, and Reitirement Category.
For the About page it will consist of more about what Investhub is and how to contact Investhub.
The Stocks category till have sub categories of Index Fund and Wall Street. The Banks category will consist of a list of information about banks and a list of credit cards. The Retirement category will consist of two sub category which is the Social Security category and the 401k category.
The header in my main website will have a main will have a subscription and newsletter information along with a header which is About Investhub, Stocks Banks, and Retirement.
