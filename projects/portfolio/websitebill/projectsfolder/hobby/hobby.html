    <div>
      <h2>Introduction:</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Bill Jason I'am a college student currently in City College of San Francisco (CCSF) from San Francisco,CA and my hobby is Scuba Diving. I've been scuba diving for 5 years and currenly have a "Open water PADI certification". Scuba diving is considered one if the best recreational activities known world wide. You can do Scuba diving for fun activities or professionally in relations to scientific research, public safety, and military. The reason why I'am doing scuba diving is because I love being in the ocean and enjoy thrills that is challenges. Scuba Diving helps me explore a new world under the ocean. Looking or Observing reefs, and different types of sea creature make you curious about their livelihood and the environment around them.

        <!--2nd paragraph: contains instruction on how to do your hobby for someone thst has never done your hobby.<br>-->
        First thing you should understand when it comes to learning how to be a Scuba Diver is it's for everybody from age 10 and up .
        Go to a professional scuba diving school and apply for a PADI certification course. Understanding diving gears, safety, certification courses and tips as a beginner. There are three phases to start scuba diving, first is the classroom lecture combined with physics and physiology of scuba diving; then you will be staring to learn scuba diving in a confined water training location (training pool). The last part of the phase to you will be conducting your open water training in the ocean that is below 25-35 feet deep. The reason why I enjoy scuba diving is because learning scuba diving helps me learn somthing about scuba diving and how your body reacts to the oxgyen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide when going underwater. The more you understand about scuba diving the more well rounded you are in this type of recreation to acquire more certificates.
